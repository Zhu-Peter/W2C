    <h1>This is Assignment 2</h1>
    <p>In the last week I learned about the bash environment, It is different from the windows shell console and comes with many different commands to navigate such as cd to move to directories and ls to list the file content. By doing cd .. one can move back to a previous directory and pwd can show the current absolute address you are at. To make a file, use the touch command, to move it use mv. To add text into a file, use echo "message" >> file, and to check the content of a file use cat. </p>
